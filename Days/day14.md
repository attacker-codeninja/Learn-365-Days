# **API7:2019** **Security Misconfigurations**

Security Misconfiguration is when the security features of a system are not configured correctly or are unintentionally disabled. This can leave the system vulnerable to hunter.

For example, a financial institution has an internal network with multiple layers of security, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). These security measures should be properly configured in order to stay ahead of any potential threats. However, if one of the configurations is incorrect or inadvertently left off, this could leave the institution open to attacks from hackers.

# How to detect Security Misconfiguration?

# ****Example****

API Security Misconfiguration occurs when APIs are not properly configured to protect critical data or resources. for example A company implements an API to give their customer additional features on a mobile app. However, the actual implementation process was handled by a third-party developer who left the authentication process open for anyone to bypass and access customer data. As a result, malicious actors were able to use the open authentication process to gain access customer data, exposing the company's sensitive information and leaving them vulnerable to attack. a real world api Misconfiguration happen on 2018, A hacker gained access to the data of more than 500,000 users due to a misconfigured API
